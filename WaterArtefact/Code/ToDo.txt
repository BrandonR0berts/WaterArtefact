// Testing data collection //
- Determine which sections need their times captured
- Create functionality for running a test that ImGui will hook into

- Adjust the vertex generation code to fix issues when going diagonal wave directions

- Add summing of multiple gerstner waves
- Add presets for sine waves
- Add presets for gerstner waves

- Add tessendorf appraoch
	- Solve how to represent an FFT (and complex numbers) in code

- Add outputting of normals and tangents from the compute shaders
	- Sine waves
	- Gerstner waves
	- Tessendorf approach
